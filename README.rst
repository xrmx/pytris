pytris
======

A skeleton project for creating a simple Tic-tac-toe implementation.

Instructions
------------

Fork this repository and extend this project in order to create a
tic-tac-toe implementation.
You are free to choose a procedural or object-oriented approach
to solve the problem.
Your code must be tested (and testable ;) and tests must pass.

You are encouraged to commit often, my suggestion is to do at least
one commit for each task in the following checklist. Once you
have completed a task you should check the task in the checklist, by
writing an x inside the relevant square.

- [] program should ask the name of the two players
- [] program should ask each player to do their move by their name
- [] program should check at each turn if one player won. If they won
  the program should print the name of the winner and exit.


Please be aware that projects with a single commit won't be accepted as valid.
